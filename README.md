# sign-up-form

This is an HTML-CSS only attempt at a Sign Up form.  
This is also my first time trying to make a website responsive and thinking about how it would look on mobile.
Check it out <a href="https://notkatsa.github.io/sign-up-form/">here.</a>  
Things I learned about in the process:  
* Styling forms.  
* Styling grids.  
* Using background images.  
* Responsive design.
